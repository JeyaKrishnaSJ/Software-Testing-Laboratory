### Aim
Write a program in Python language to search a given element is present in the list using Binary search. Introspect the causes for its failure and write down the possible reasons for its failure.

### Algorithm:


1. Start the program. 
2. Get the list from the user 
3. Get the element to be searched 
4. Compare the mid element with the key, if same return the index 
5. If key is greater, search it in the right side, else search it in the left side. 
6. If not found return -1 
7. Stop the program.

### Program:
```
def binary_search(arr, x): 
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    mid = 0
    
    while low <= high: 
        mid = (high + low) // 2
 
        if arr[mid] < x: 
            low = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] > x: 
            high = mid - 1
        else: 
            return mid  
    return -1  
arr = [2, 3, 4, 10, 40]
x = input("Enter the element to be searched: ")
try: 
    x = int(x)  
    result = binary_search(arr, x)
    
    if result != -1: 
        print("Element is present at index", str(result))
    else: 
        print("Element is not present in array")
except ValueError: 
    print("Enter a valid input!")
```



### Output:

```
Enter the element to be searched: 5
Element is not present in array

Enter the element to be searched: 4
Element is present at index 2

Enter the element to be searched: h
Enter a valid input!

Enter the element to be searched:  
Enter a valid input!

Enter the element to be searched: -8
Element is not present in array

Enter the element to be searched: 88
Element is not present in array

Enter the element to be searched: jk
Enter a valid input!

Enter the element to be searched: 789
Element is not present in array

Enter the element to be searched: 40
Element is present at index 4
```

### Result:
Thus, the python program of binary search is implemented and the output is verified 
successfully.
